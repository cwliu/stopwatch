#Basic functionality of this stopwatch

- Start / Stop the stopwatch with a tap anywhere on the screen
- Reset the timer when shaking the phone

  - Clock animation must only be visible when the stopwatch is running. Otherwise it is invisible and the timer label is positioned in the center of the screen.
